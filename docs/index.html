      I am a second year PhD student at Durham University. In my research I study stellar dynamics in cosmological simulations. 
      This is the study of orbits in the galaxy, which helps us understand the distribution of matter as well as the assembly history of galaxies. 
      I focus on analogues of our own Milky Way, that is barred galaxies of a similar mass range, in order to be able to gain a better understanding of our own galaxy.

    <p><font size="5">In addition to my research, I enjoy conducting science outreach for children from local schools in the North East, for example by narrating planetarium shows and showcasing the simulations developed at Durham University. 
      I also demonstrate in undergraduate teaching at the university, including student laboratories.
